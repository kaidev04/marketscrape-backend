# marketscrape-test-backend
This is a school project intended as a website that scrapes tweets containing stock tickers from Twitter and perform sentiment analysis on collected tweets to find correlation between Twitter sentiment and stocks. The project is divided into two repositories, one for back end and one for front end. It would be better two have both in one repository but I have not had the time to merge the two repositories.

Python was used to scraped tweets. While it is a better idea to use the Twitter API directly with Javascript, I had some issues getting the API up and running as well as facing API limitations. Will return to the project in the future and add API communication for faster collection of tweets rather than scraping.
